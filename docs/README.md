# Documentation for `regular_precession`

This folder is intended for project documentation. You can expand it into a full documentation site using tools like [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) or [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

## Suggested Structure

- `index.md` or `index.rst`: Main entry point for documentation.
- `installation.md`: Detailed installation instructions, including dependencies.
- `usage.md`: How to use the main scripts, classes, and notebooks.
- `api/`: (optional) Auto-generated API documentation from your Python docstrings.
- `examples/`: (optional) Example scripts or notebook guides.

## Getting Started

1. Place your main documentation files here.
2. If using Sphinx, run `sphinx-quickstart` in this directory.
3. If using MkDocs, run `mkdocs new .` in this directory.

## Quick Start Example

- To build HTML docs with Sphinx:
  ```sh
  cd docs
  sphinx-quickstart
  # Edit conf.py and index.rst as needed
  make html
  ```
- To build with MkDocs:
  ```sh
  cd docs
  mkdocs new .
  mkdocs serve
  ```

For now, see the main `README.md` in the repo root for a project overview.
