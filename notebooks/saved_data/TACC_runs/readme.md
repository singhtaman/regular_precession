## TACC for distingushable fractions


We used TACC HPC ressources to calculate fractions of distingushable precessing binaries for either fixed binary precession parameters -- MC'ing over sky localization and binary orientation -- or varying binary precession parameters -- MC'ing over sky location and binary orientation along with random initial spin orientations (within the spin orientation model) leading to random binary precession parameters.

We have the values saved in folders table_2 (for fixed precession params) and table_3 (for varying precession params).
